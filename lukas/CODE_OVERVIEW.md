## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of our machine learning model’s modular code structure. The project has been divided into four main components—data preprocessing, model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation—to enhance maintainability and simplify further development.

## Preprocessing

**File:** `preprocess.py`

**Purpose:**  
- Load raw data from CSV files using pandas.
- Normalize and transform the features using StandardScaler.
- Split the processed data into training and testing sets.

**Key Functions:**  
- `load_data(filepath)`: Loads raw data from the specified file path.
- `preprocess_data(data)`: Separates features and labels, then scales the features.
- `get_train_test_data(filepath, test_size, random_state)`: Combines data loading and preprocessing and performs a train-test split.

## Model Architecture

**File:** `model.py`

**Purpose:**  
- Define the neural network architecture using PyTorch.
- Implement a simple feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer.

**Key Components:**  
- **MyModel Class:**  
  - **Layers:**  
    - Input layer that accepts feature vectors.
    - Hidden layer with ReLU activation for non-linearity.
    - Output layer that produces class scores.
- **Forward Pass:**  
  - Implements the propagation of input data through the layers to generate predictions.

## Training Procedure

**File:** `train.py`

**Purpose:**  
- Train the neural network using the preprocessed data.

**Training Process:**  
- Convert training data into PyTorch tensors.
- Use the Adam optimizer along with CrossEntropyLoss to minimize prediction error.
- Iterate over a set number of epochs, performing forward passes, calculating loss, backpropagating errors, and updating model parameters.

**Key Function:**  
- `train_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs, lr)`: Handles the training loop and outputs loss values for each epoch.

## Evaluation

**File:** `evaluate.py`

**Purpose:**  
- Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the test dataset.

**Evaluation Process:**  
- Set the model to evaluation mode.
- Convert test data to PyTorch tensors and obtain predictions.
- Calculate the accuracy metric using scikit-learn’s `accuracy_score`.

**Key Function:**  
- `evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)`: Computes and prints the accuracy of the model on the test data.
